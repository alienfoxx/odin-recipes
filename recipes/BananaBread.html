         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <p>You likely already have all the ingredients you'll need for this banana bread recipe on hand.
         If not, here's what to add to your grocery list:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.</li>
            <li>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener,
                 which means it helps the banana bread rise.</li>
            <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf taste salty.</li>
            <li>Butter: A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor.</li>
            <li>Brown sugar: Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.</li>
            <li>Eggs: Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter together.</li>
            <li>Bananas: Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.</li>
         </ul>
