    <img src="/images/ChickenParmPizza.jpg">

    <p> This pizza comes together in a flash and looks like one you'd get from a fancy pizza joint.
         The key is to use a brand of nuggets you are familiar with and enjoy.
        Don't skip the fresh basil--that extra layer of flavor makes the whole pizza pop.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 frozen chicken nuggets</li>
        <li>1 12-inch pre-baked pizza crust</li>
        <li>1/2 cup marinara sauce</li>
        <li>2 button mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>6 basil leaves, cut into thin ribbons</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>

             Arrange nuggets in a single layer on a pizza pan. </li>
        <li>Bake nuggets in the pre-heated oven for 10 minutes or according to package directions;
